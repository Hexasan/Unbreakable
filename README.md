Unbreakable is a Fabric mod that reworks the item damage (durability) system to be more fun for the player in various
aspects, rebalance the overall gameplay loop, and generally add more nuance to weapons and tools.

**__Required Dependencies__**:

- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)
- [owo-lib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)
- [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) (optional)

## Main Features

The main feature of this mod is that your favorite tools can no longer break. Instead, items will become "Shattered" at
negative durability, getting progressively weaker as they're damaged and eventually becoming useless. Shattered items
can still be repaired, but it may be more expensive.

**Durability has also received many tweaks:**

- The durability lost when performing an action now scales with the action itself. Tools lose more durability based on
  the block mined, and weapons lose more durability based on the damage dealt and how early you attacked.
- All items that can shatter have half their normal durability to account for shattering, which adds triple the
  effective durability.
- Weapons deal extra-critical damage on break.
- Anvils no longer have a price cap for repairing, and repair cost scales with the item's enchantments rather than the
  amount of times you repair it.

**And yes, the mod is fully customizable!**
All features are 100% configurable using [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and can be tweaked or disabled.
If you like, you can disable and/or tweak every feature of the mod, individually!
